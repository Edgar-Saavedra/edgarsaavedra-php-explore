/**
	* General Notes:
	* - within double quotes will result in their represented values printed, not their literal values.
	* - PHP has four functions for incorporating external files: include(), include_once(), require(), and require_once()
	* - include_once('filename.php'); require('/path/to/filename.html');
	* - If an include() function doesn’t work (it cannot include the file for some reason), a warning will be printed to the Web browser A,
	* 		but the script will CONTINUE TO RUN (include). If require() FAILES, an error is printed and the script is halted B
	* 		Both functions also have a *_once() version, which guarantees that the file in question is included only once regardless of how many times a script may (presumably inadvertently) attempt to include it.
	*
	* 		Because require_once() and include_ once() require extra work from the PHP module (i.e., PHP must first check that the file has not already been included), it’s best
					not to use these two functions unless a redundant include is likely to occur
	*
	* 		Since require() has more impact on a script when it fails, it’s recommended for mission-critical includes (like those that con- nect to a database).
	* 		The include( ) function would be used for less important inclusions.
	*
	* - Variable Scope
	* 		For starters, variables have the scope of the page in which they reside.
	* 		Since included files act as if they were part of the original (including) script,
	* 		variables defined before an include() line are available to the included file
